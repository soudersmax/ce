    "* Don't forget the assumptions and key ideas:\n",
    "    1. The partition is the first element in the array\n",
    "    2. i separates the < p and > p elements\n",
    "    3. j separates the 'seen' from the 'unseen'\n",

    "    * A[i], ..., A[j-i] > pivot\n",

    "    2. Half of the  lements will give us this \"good enough\" split\n",
    "        * Ex: In an array of integers 1 - 100, the pivots that will give us 25-75 split or better is any number between 26-75 (inclusive), which is a full half of the items in the array\n",

    "    * _Note: No assumptions about data, it holds for every input_\n",
